h1. Signals: Think Outside the Event.

*Signals* are light-weight, strongly-typed AS3 messaging tools.
Wire your application with better APIs and less boilerplate than AS3 Events.

h2. Concept

 * A *Signal* is essentially a mini-dispatcher specific to one event, with its own array of listeners.
 * A Signal gives an event a concrete membership in a class. 
 * Listeners subscribe to real objects, not to string-based channels.
 * Event string constants are no longer needed.
 * Signals are inspired by "C# events":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_syntax#Events and  "signals/slots":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signals_and_slots in Qt. 

h2. Syntax

<pre><code>// with EventDispatcher
button.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, onClick);

// Signal equivalent; past tense is recommended
button.clicked.add(onClicked);
</code></pre>
